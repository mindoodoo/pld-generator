# User wish

**As the:** developer

**I want to:** I would like to have a compact protoboard circuit that would interface and power my microcontroller with all my other sensors and outputs.

# Description

The protoboard should be able to connect to an arduino nano. It should include a 5V power input in order to power the arduino and sensors. The board contains male pin headers for every sensor and output correctly wired to the arduino nano socket.

# DOD

- Contains socket for arduino nano
- Power pins powering arduino nano
- Header pins to interface external sensors
  - Must be correctly wired (power and data connections)
  - EC Sensor
  - pH Sensor
  - Temp Sensor
  - Relays
